abstract = {With the advent of the information society, the eyes' health is threatened all over the world. Rules and systems have been proposed to avoid these problems, but most users do not use them due to the physical and time constraints and costs involved and the lack of awareness of eye health. In this paper, we estimate the eye fatigue sensitivity by detecting spontaneous blinks with high accuracy. The experimental results show that the proposed Eye Aspect Ratio Mapping can classify blinks with high accuracy at a low cost. We also found a strong correlation between the median SBR (Spontaneous Blink Rate) and the time between the objective estimation of eye fatigue and the subject's awareness of eye fatigue.}
